# Hello, World!

Python is a very simple language and has a very straight forward syntax. It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate(prepared) code.

# Two Major Version of Python:
* Python 2
In this the "print" statement is not a function and therefore it is invoked without parentheses.

* Python 3
It is a function, and must be invoked with parantheses 

# Variable and Types:

Python is completely object oriented and not "statistical typed". We do not need to declare variable and their type. Every variable in python is an object.

## Python support 2 types of numbers:
* Integer (whole numbers)
* Floating point (decimals)
