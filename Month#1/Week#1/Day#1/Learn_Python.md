# Hello, World!

Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate (prepared) code.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
# Indentation:
Python uses indentation for blocks, instead of curly braces. Both tabs and spaces are supported, but the standard indentation requires standard Python code to use four spaces.
* For example:
```python
x = 1
if x == 1:
    # indented four spaces
    print("x is 1.")
```

# Variables and Types:

Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed".

## Python supports two types of numbers: 
* integers(whole numbers) 
* floating point numbers(decimals)

```python
myfloat = 7.0
print(myfloat)
myfloat = float(7)
print(myfloat)
```
