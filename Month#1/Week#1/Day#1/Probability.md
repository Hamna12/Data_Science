## Probability:
It is the measure of likelihood of an event.
### Example:
* Tossing a coin
* Rolling a dice

Then we studied Mutual and Non Mutual Exclusive Event
And then we studied Additive Rule Formulas.

# Additive Rule Formulas:
* Mutual Exclusion
 Pr(A or B) = Pr(A) + Pr(B)
* Non Mutual Exclusion
 Pr(A or B) = Pr(A) + Pr(B) - Pr(A n B)

# Multiplicative Rule:
1. Independent Event
e.g. Tossing a coin
S={H,T,H}
Pr(H)=1/2  , Pr(T)=1/2

2. Dependent Event
e.g. Taking a card from a deck
Experiment #01: Pr(K) =1/52
Experiment #02: Pr(Q) = 1/51

# Question #01:

## Independent Event:
Pr(A and B) = Pr(A) * Pr(B)
Pr(1 and 3) = Pr(1) * Pr(3)
            = 1/6 * 1/6 
            = 1/36
