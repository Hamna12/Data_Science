# What we can do with Python?

Python is multipurpose programming language. It can uses for variety of different tasks.

* It is very good programming language for ML projects
* It is also very popular in  web development.
* By using python framework of Django we can built amazing website.

## There are 5 websites powered by Python and Django:

## The most popular code for python is Pycharm

```python
print("Hello, World!)
```
This is string . String means sequence of character or textual data.

# "Variables"

We use variables to temporary store data into computer's memory.
* e.g. age=20  (so we have age value in memory location)

Exercise:
```python
name = "John Smith"
age = 20
status = "New Patient"
print(name, age, status)
```
# How to use input function in python?

```python
name=input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello" + name)
```
This is called concatenation.

# Types of Data in Python:

1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean

# How to calculate Age?

```python
birth_year = input("Enter your birth year: ")
age = 2020 - int(birth_year)
print(age)
```

# Built-in Function:

1. int()
2. float()
3. bool()
4. str()

These are used for converting type of variables.

# Convert String into upper case:

```python
course = "Python for beginner"
print(course.upper())
```

# Augmented Assignment operator:

```python
x = 10
x = x+3
x += 3
```
This is augmented assignment operator.

# Tuples:

Tuples are kind of like lists we use them to store a sequence of objects.

* Tuples are immutable which means we cannot change them once we created.

## Example:

```python
number = (1,2,3)
number[0]=5
```
This will show error because it is immutable.
