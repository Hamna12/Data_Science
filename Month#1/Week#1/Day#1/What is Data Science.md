# What is Data Science?
## Overviwe:
Data Scientist play vital role in industry like they can check which website have more reviews, which movie have more rating and we can answer 
who will win the election.
* If Data Scientists Exist we may have alot of advantages and due to their absence we can face disadvantages:
# Advantages:
We may have many advantages which are uncountable but few are mentioning here:
* They can minimize Car accidents
* In Airlines data science contribute in a big major way flights can be delayed due to weather conditions.
### If Data Scientists don't Exists we can face disadvantages:
# Disadvantages:
1. Due to lack of Data available, flights are often delayed or cancelled at last time.
2. Due to improper route planning
Data Science can avoid these challenges.

* Need of Data Science:
1. Better Descion Making
2. Predictive Analysis
3. Pattern Discovery
* Solving Problems:
Data Scientist can solve problems first by selecting data then perform data Preprocessing clean data and then perform Exploratory Data Analysis to give it to good picture.
Prerequisites For Data Science:
## Following are the essential skills.
1. Curiosity
2. Common Sense
3. Communication Skills
## Important Programming languages for Data Science:
Python and R 
Python is one of easiest and interpreted programming language.
* Tools for Data Science:
Data Scientist use different tools for Analysis they can use SAS, Jupyter, R studio. For Data warehousing AWS Redshift, Talend For Machine learning: Azure ML studio, Spark MLib and for Data Visualization they use Jupyter and Tableau that is the most important Visualization tool.
# Life Cycle:
So first Data Scientist should have understanding of business model then asking questions what type of data is available.Next step is to clean data it can be called data munging. It is most imp aspect of Data science life cycle for any valueable insights.
# Important point:
* If we have Null values in our data set we can fill Null values by taking mean of remaining the entire data. 
* If we have large amount of data we can drop Null values.

* Demand for Data Science:
Data Scientists are in huge demand in many industries. Industries like 
1. Technology
2. Marketing
3. Finance
4. Healthcare
5. Gaming

So in short we can say as Data is everywhere so there is huge amount of data with us so we  must need Data Scientists. Where they can perform their skills and can present the data in informative form like what actually is data telling .
